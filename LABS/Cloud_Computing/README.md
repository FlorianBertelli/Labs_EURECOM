# CLOUD COMPUTING

This fold contains all my labs about Cloud Computing. 

Indeed, all labs start with an non distributed implementation of the algorithm (Kmeans, Gradient Descent
and its various forms), some discussion about parameters, and then an implementation using Spark, with the Map Reduce Framework.

The last lab, SparkSQL, is about how to use spark sql, on a distributed data set.
