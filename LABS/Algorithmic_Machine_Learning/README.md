# Algorithmic Machine Learning

This fold contains 4 project, which are concrete applications of machine learning algorithms, like Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network,
Random Forest, XGBOOST, etc... This implies data preprocessing, understanding, model selection, parameter optimization, hyper parameter tuning,
analyses of the model (how to distribute it on a Cloud, time performance, limitation)

The first lab is RecSys and deals with a Recommandation System for a music application (as Deezer or Spotify)
The second lab is House Pricing PRediction, which is inspired from the Kaggle Competition, where the aim is to predict the price of some houses according to a bench of features
The third lab is Plankton Challenge, where the aim is to classify from raw images which kind of plankton it is.
The last lab is Anomaly Detection, where the aim is to detect anomaly detection in some servers.
